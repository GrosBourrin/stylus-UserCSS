# Description

This is my personal approach on amazon.de

- Change colors
- Get rid of self-advertisement (which is often not blocked by adblockers) and unnecessary big margins
- Prevent too small review percentage bars when using [Amazon show absolute review numbers](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/369355) UserScript or enlarge the bars simply for better visibility and less wasted free space.


It should also work for other amazon country domains, but is untested.

In general the code of this style is highly unstructured and I just freely add stuff when I see something flashing or unpleasant.
But the good thing is you are very free to change the colors - either via style settings or for advanced users in the `:root` section of the style code.
