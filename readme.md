# Description

This repository contains UserCSS styles for restyling websites.  
Many styles feature options to alter colors or switch modifications on or off.

A browser extension is needed to inject the UserCSS into a site.  
I personally use and recommend [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) which is officially available for Firefox, Chrome and Opera.  
For easy installation, just use the "Install directly with Stylus" button which can be found in every style's readme.
